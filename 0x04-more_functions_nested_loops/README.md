# ALX SE Project: 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program and focuses on further developing your skills in C programming by working with functions and nested loops. It includes a series of tasks that involve implementing various functions and programs that utilize these concepts.

## Tasks

### Task 0: 0-isupper.c

Description: Implement a function that checks for uppercase characters.

### Task 1: 1-isdigit.c

Description: Implement a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

### Task 2: 2-mul.c

Description: Implement a function that multiplies two integers.

### Task 3: 3-print_numbers.c

Description: Implement a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9.

### Task 4: 4-print_most_numbers.c

Description: Implement a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4.

### Task 5: 5-more_numbers.c

Description: Implement a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 14 ten times.

### Task 6: 6-print_line.c

Description: Implement a function that draws a straight line using underscores.

### Task 7: 7-print_diagonal.c

Description: Implement a function that draws a diagonal line using backslashes.

### Task 8: 8-print_square.c

Description: Implement a function that prints a square of a specified size.

### Task 9: 9-fizz_buzz.c

Description: Implement the FizzBuzz program, printing numbers from 1 to 100 with specific rules.

### Task 10: 10-print_triangle.c

Description: Implement a function that prints a triangle of a specified size.

### Task 100: 100-prime_factor.c

Description: Implement a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of a given number.

### Task 101: 101-print_number.c

Description: Implement a function that prints an integer without using any standard library functions like `printf`.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:

- How to work with functions in C and create custom functions to perform specific tasks.
- How to use nested loops effectively to solve various problems.
- How to work with control structures and conditional statements to create more complex programs.
- The importance of code organization and documentation for maintainable code.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of C programming, functions, and nested loops, which are fundamental concepts in computer programming. It also provided valuable practice in problem-solving and algorithm development.
